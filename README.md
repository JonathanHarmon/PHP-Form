# PHP-Form
This is a basic PHP form that uses regex expressions to validate and some CSS for basic styling

Next steps would be to seperate styling out to it's own CSS file and rework it to make it look more modern.

The form currently doesn't submit the content to anywhere, but does output content to the screen.
